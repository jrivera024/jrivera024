Hello, my name is Joseph Rivera, and I was a student at Per Scholas, specializing in cybersecurity. My passion for technology and for troubleshooting have been throughout my academic journey, where I've consistently grasped complex concepts and applied them practically.

I am pursuing a job like this because I'm driven by the ever-evolving  technology and the opportunity it provides to contribute to efficient and reliable systems that support businesses and individuals. I enjoy the challenge of resolving technical issues and providing seamless support to users.

I believe I am uniquely qualified for this because in addition to my technical skills, I bring a strong ethical foundation and a strong commitment to continuous learning.

After completing my program at Per Scholas, I will be looking for opportunities to apply my cybersecurity knowledge and skills to protect organizations from cyber threats. I'm seeking a role where I can make a meaningful impact in strengthening security measures and educating users on best practices.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
